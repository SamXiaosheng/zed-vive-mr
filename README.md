# Mixed Reality ZED and OpenVR App

This is a test app to do a mixed reality mirror view of the VR scene
using the [ZED](https://www.stereolabs.com/zed/) camera. The calibration
mode assumes the camera is tracked by one of the controllers, which is chosen
by pressing the trigger on the user's controller (the one not tracking
the ZED). Support for the HTC Vive Tracker will be added once I
get one to test with.

The approach is the same as the [Unity Green Screen Mixed Reality](https://www.stereolabs.com/documentation/mixed-reality/unity/green-screen-vr.html), however doesn't use or need a green screen
at the moment, since I don't have one setup.
